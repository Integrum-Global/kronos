# Kronos - Automated Investment System PRD

## Overview
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the design and requirements for Kronos, an automated financial investment system. The documentation follows a user-centric approach, starting from user personas and working backwards to technology requirements.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. User Research
- **[User Personas](./01-user-personas.md)** - Detailed profiles of target users who would benefit from automated investing
- **[User Needs Analysis](./02-user-needs.md)** - Core problems and needs each persona faces

### 2. User Experience Design
- **[User Flows](./03-user-flows.md)** - Comprehensive user journeys for each persona
- **[User Objectives](./04-user-objectives.md)** - Valuable outcomes each flow delivers

### 3. System Design
- **[Consolidated Workflows](./05-consolidated-workflows.md)** - Generalized end-to-end workflows
- **[System Architecture](./06-system-architecture.md)** - High-level technical design

### 4. Visual Documentation
- **[Diagrams](./diagrams/)** - Visual representations of flows and architecture
  - User journey maps
  - System flow diagrams
  - Architecture diagrams

## Quick Navigation

| Document | Purpose | Key Audience |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| User Personas | Understand who we're building for | Product, Design, Engineering |
| User Flows | See how users interact with the system | Design, Engineering |
| Consolidated Workflows | Technical implementation guide | Engineering, QA |
| System Architecture | Technical infrastructure | Engineering, DevOps |

## Key Principles
1. **User-First Design** - Every feature must solve a real user problem
2. **Accessibility** - System should be usable by both novice and expert investors
3. **Transparency** - Users should understand how their investments are managed
4. **Security** - Financial data and transactions must be highly secure
5. **Scalability** - System should handle growth in users and transaction volume

## Getting Started
Start with [User Personas](./01-user-personas.md) to understand our target users, then follow the documentation structure sequentially for a complete understanding of the system requirements.
