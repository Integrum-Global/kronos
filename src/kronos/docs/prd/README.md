## Quick Navigation

| Document | Purpose | Key Audience |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| User Personas | Understand who we're building for | Product, Design, Engineering |
| User Flows | See how users interact with the system | Design, Engineering |
| Consolidated Workflows | Technical implementation guide | Engineering, QA |
| System Architecture | Technical infrastructure | Engineering, DevOps |

## Key Principles
1. **User-First Design** - Every feature must solve a real user problem
2. **Accessibility** - System should be usable by both novice and expert investors
3. **Transparency** - Users should understand how their investments are managed
4. **Security** - Financial data and transactions must be highly secure
5. **Scalability** - System should handle growth in users and transaction volume

## Getting Started

‚ö†Ô∏è **Start Here**: Read [Reality Check Summary](./10-reality-check-summary.md) first to understand the true complexity and costs.

Then proceed with:
1. [Regulatory Compliance](./07-regulatory-compliance.md) - Understand legal requirements
2. [Business Model](./08-business-model.md) - Review unit economics
3. [MVP Phasing](./09-mvp-phasing-roadmap.md) - See realistic timeline
4. [User Personas](./01-user-personas.md) - Understand target users

Only after understanding the above should you dive into technical implementation details.
