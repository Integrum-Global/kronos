# ADR-004: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The technology stack for Kronos must balance multiple competing requirements:
- **Regulatory**: Audit trails, data retention, security standards
- **Financial**: Real-time calculations, exact precision, consistency
- **Operational**: 24/7 availability, disaster recovery, monitoring
- **Development**: Hiring ease, maintainability, ecosystem
- **Business**: Time to market, costs, scalability

Given our decision to start with a pragmatic MVP approach (ADR-001), we need a technology stack that is proven in financial services, has strong talent availability, and can scale from 100 to 100,000+ customers.

### Industry Analysis
Current fintech technology trends:
- **Leaders**: Python/Java backends, React/Next.js frontends, AWS/GCP cloud
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for transactions, Redis for caching
- **Messaging**: Kafka for events, RabbitMQ/SQS for queues
- **Monitoring**: DataDog, New Relic, or Prometheus
- **Security**: Vault for secrets, OAuth2/OIDC for auth

### Key Constraints
1. **Decimal Precision**: Financial calculations require exact decimal math
2. **Audit Requirements**: Every change must be traceable
3. **Integration Needs**: Must work with legacy financial APIs
4. **Compliance Tools**: Must support required compliance systems
5. **Talent Pool**: Must be able to hire experienced developers

## Decision
Adopt a **Conservative, Proven Technology Stack** optimized for financial services reliability over cutting-edge innovation.

### Technology Evolution Path

#### Phase 1: Monolithic MVP
```python
# Simple monolithic structure
project_structure = {
    "api/": "FastAPI application",
    "models/": "SQLAlchemy models",
    "services/": "Business logic",
    "tasks/": "Background jobs",
    "tests/": "Test suite"
}

# Single deployment
deployment = {
    "app": "ECS Fargate",
    "db": "RDS PostgreSQL",
    "cache": "ElastiCache Redis",
    "cdn": "CloudFront"
}
```

#### Phase 2: Service Separation
```yaml
services:
  user_service:
    - Authentication
    - Profile management
    - Preferences
    
  portfolio_service:
    - Holdings
    - Calculations
    - Rebalancing
    
  trading_service:
    - Order management
    - Execution
    - Settlement
    
  compliance_service:
    - KYC/AML
    - Monitoring
    - Reporting
```

#### Phase 3: Event-Driven Architecture
```yaml
event_system:
  broker: AWS EventBridge or Kafka
  patterns:
    - Event sourcing for audit
    - CQRS for read scaling
    - Saga for transactions
```

## Consequences

### Positive

## Bottom Line
This technology stack prioritizes **reliability, maintainability, and speed to market** over technical innovation. It's a pragmatic choice that acknowledges the realities of building a financial services platform with limited resources.

The stack can evolve as the business grows, but starting simple and proven gives the highest chance of reaching product-market fit before running out of capital.
