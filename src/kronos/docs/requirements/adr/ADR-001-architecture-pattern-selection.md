# ADR-001: Architecture Pattern Selection

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Kronos needs to choose between two fundamentally different architectural approaches:

1. **Original Vision**: A cutting-edge, fully automated investment platform with real-time everything, AI-driven decisions, and seamless user experience
2. **Reality Check**: A pragmatic, compliant investment platform that acknowledges regulatory constraints, operational realities, and sustainable economics

This decision impacts every aspect of the system from technology choices to team composition to funding requirements.

### Current Landscape Analysis
The robo-advisor market in 2024 shows:
- **Winners**: Focused on compliance-first, simple offerings, patient growth
- **Losers**: Tried to innovate too quickly, ignored regulations, burned cash
- **Market Reality**: 10-20% success rate for new entrants
- **Capital Requirements**: $50M+ to reach profitability

### Constraints
1. **Regulatory**: SEC, FINRA, state regulations are non-negotiable
2. **Financial**: Limited runway requires path to profitability
3. **Technical**: Must integrate with legacy financial systems
4. **Operational**: 24/7 support is mandatory
5. **Trust**: One major incident can kill the business

## Decision
We will adopt the **Reality Check Architecture** with a phased approach that starts extremely simple and adds complexity only after proving each phase works.

### Architecture Principles
1. **Compliance First**: Every feature must pass compliance review
2. **Manual Then Automated**: Start with manual processes, automate later
3. **Proven Technology**: Use boring, reliable technology stack
4. **Partner Over Build**: Use existing services wherever possible
5. **Gradual Complexity**: Add features only after core is stable

### Technical Architecture

#### Phase 1 (MVP) - Monolithic Simplicity
```yaml
architecture:
  pattern: monolithic_web_application
  
  frontend:
    framework: Next.js
    hosting: Vercel
    complexity: minimal
  
  backend:
    framework: Python_FastAPI
    hosting: AWS_Elastic_Beanstalk
    database: Single_PostgreSQL_RDS
    
  integrations:
    custodian: Direct_API_only
    kyc: Jumio_SaaS
    banking: Plaid_only
    
  operations:
    deployment: Manual_with_checklist
    monitoring: CloudWatch_basics
    support: Email_only
```

#### Phase 2 - Service Separation
```yaml
architecture:
  pattern: service_oriented
  
  services:
    - user_service: Authentication and profiles
    - portfolio_service: Investment logic
    - trading_service: Order management
    - compliance_service: Regulatory checks
    
  communication:
    sync: REST_APIs
    async: AWS_SQS
    
  infrastructure:
    container: Docker_on_ECS
    database: PostgreSQL_with_read_replicas
    caching: Redis_for_sessions
```

#### Phase 3 - Microservices (If Needed)
Only after reaching $1B AUM and 20,000+ customers

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Lower Risk**: Proven patterns reduce failure probability
2. **Faster Launch**: 6-12 months vs 18-24 months
3. **Cheaper Operations**: $3.5M year 1 vs $10M+
4. **Easier Hiring**: Standard skills vs exotic expertise
5. **Better Compliance**: Simple systems easier to audit
6. **Clearer Path**: Each phase has specific gates

### Negative
1. **Less Differentiation**: Harder to stand out
2. **Technical Debt**: Manual processes need eventual automation
3. **Scaling Challenges**: Monolith has limits
4. **Feature Limitations**: Can't offer everything competitors do
5. **Talent Attraction**: Less exciting for engineers

### Risk Mitigation
- **Differentiation**: Focus on service and trust, not features
- **Technical Debt**: Budget 20% time for refactoring
- **Scaling**: Plan service separation from start
- **Features**: Customer research before building
- **Talent**: Emphasize impact and growth opportunity

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Original Vision Architecture
**Description**: Microservices, real-time everything, AI-first, cloud-native

**Pros**:
- Technical excellence
- Infinite scalability
- Feature richness
- Engineering attraction

**Cons**:
- 24+ month build time
- $100M+ funding needed
- Regulatory complexity
- Operational nightmare
- 90% failure risk

**Why Rejected**: Unrealistic timeline and funding requirements

### Option 2: White-Label Solution
**Description**: Use existing platform, focus on marketing

**Pros**:
- 3-month launch
- Proven technology
- Lower risk
- Cheaper initially

**Cons**:
- No differentiation
- Margin compression
- Limited control
- Vendor lock-in
- Growth ceiling

**Why Rejected**: No sustainable competitive advantage

### Option 3: B2B Platform Only
**Description**: Sell technology to existing RIAs

**Pros**:
- No consumer acquisition
- Lower regulatory burden
- Faster revenue
- Higher margins

**Cons**:
- Long sales cycles
- Complex requirements
- Limited market
- Different expertise needed

**Why Rejected**: Different business than envisioned

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-12)
1. **Months 1-3**: Legal setup, compliance foundation
2. **Months 4-6**: Build monolithic application
3. **Months 7-9**: Custodian integration, testing
4. **Months 10-12**: Limited launch in Nevada

**Success Criteria**:
- 100 funded accounts
- Zero compliance violations
- <5% monthly churn
- Basic profitability model validated

### Phase 2: Product-Market Fit (Months 13-24)
1. **Months 13-15**: Mobile apps, IRA accounts
2. **Months 16-18**: Service separation begins
3. **Months 19-21**: Multi-state expansion
4. **Months 22-24**: Enhanced features

**Success Criteria**:
- 1,000 funded accounts
- $35M AUM
- Clear path to profitability
- Service architecture proven

### Phase 3: Scale (Year 3+)
1. Federal registration
2. National expansion
3. Advanced features
4. Potential microservices

**Success Criteria**:
- 10,000+ accounts
- $500M+ AUM
- Profitable operations
- Architecture supporting growth
