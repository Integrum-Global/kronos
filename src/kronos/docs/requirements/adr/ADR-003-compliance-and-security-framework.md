# ADR-003: Compliance and Security Framework

## Status
Proposed

## Context
As a financial services platform handling customer investments, Kronos faces extensive regulatory requirements and security threats. A single compliance failure or security breach could result in:
- Criminal charges against executives
- Massive fines ($1M+ per violation)
- Immediate shutdown by regulators
- Complete loss of customer trust
- Personal liability for officers

The framework we choose must balance comprehensive protection with operational efficiency and development velocity.

### Regulatory Landscape
1. **Federal Requirements**:
   - SEC registration as RIA (at $100M AUM)
   - Investment Advisers Act of 1940
   - Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules
   - Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements

2. **State Requirements**:
   - State investment advisor registration
   - Blue Sky laws compliance
   - State privacy laws (CCPA, etc.)

3. **Industry Standards**:
   - FINRA rules (through custodian)
   - Best execution requirements
   - Cybersecurity regulations

### Security Threat Landscape
- **External**: Nation-state actors, organized crime, hacktivists
- **Internal**: Rogue employees, social engineering, mistakes
- **Technical**: Zero-days, supply chain attacks, ransomware
- **Operational**: Phishing, account takeovers, wire fraud

## Decision
Implement a **Compliance-First Security Framework** that treats regulatory compliance as the foundation, with security measures built to support and exceed compliance requirements.

### Core Framework Components

    def monitor_transaction(self, transaction):
        # AML checks
        if self.is_suspicious_pattern(transaction):
            self.flag_for_sar_review(transaction)
            
        # Velocity checks
        if self.exceeds_velocity_limits(transaction):
            self.block_and_review(transaction)
            
        # Sanctions screening
        if self.matches_sanctions_list(transaction):
            self.freeze_immediately(transaction)
    
    def monitor_access(self, access_event):
        # Unusual access patterns
        if self.is_unusual_access(access_event):
            self.alert_security_team(access_event)
            
        # Data exfiltration
        if self.possible_exfiltration(access_event):
            self.block_and_investigate(access_event)
```

## Budget Requirements

### Year 1 Costs
| Category | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| CCO Salary | $200,000 | Senior hire required |
| Security Tools | $150,000 | Basic SIEM, scanning |
| Compliance Systems | $100,000 | GRC platform |
| External Audits | $75,000 | Pen tests, reviews |
| Training | $25,000 | All staff quarterly |
| Insurance | $50,000 | Cyber and E&O |
| **Total** | **$600,000** | Minimum viable |

### Ongoing Costs
- Year 2: $1M (team growth, advanced tools)
- Year 3: $1.5M (mature program)
- Year 4+: 2-3% of revenue

## Bottom Line
Compliance and security are not features—they are the foundation. Every decision must consider regulatory requirements and security implications. This framework provides the minimum viable approach that still ensures survival and growth.

The alternative to proper compliance and security is not iteration—it's investigation, fines, and failure.
