## Technical Architecture Decisions

### ADR-001: Architecture Pattern Selection
**Decision**: Start with modular monolith, evolve to microservices

**Rationale**:
- MVP needs rapid iteration
- Microservices add complexity
- Can decompose later as needed

### ADR-002: Technology Stack
**Decision**: Conservative, proven technologies

**Components**:
- Backend: Python/FastAPI
- Frontend: Next.js/React
- Database: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB
- Message Queue: Apache Kafka
- Infrastructure: AWS

### ADR-003: Database Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-database approach

**Breakdown**:
- PostgreSQL: User data, portfolios
- TimescaleDB: Time-series market data
- Redis: Sessions, caching
- S3: Document storage

### ADR-004: Integration Approach
**Decision**: API-first with circuit breakers

**Strategy**:
- RESTful APIs for custodians
- WebSocket for market data
- Circuit breakers for resilience
- Message queues for async processing

## Three Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: B2B Platform (40% success probability)
**Target**: Existing RIAs and financial advisors

**Modified Requirements**:
- Multi-tenant architecture
- White-label capabilities
- Advisor dashboards
- Bulk operations support

### Option 2: Financial Planning Tools (50% success probability)
**Target**: DIY investors

**Modified Requirements**:
- No custodial integration needed
- Focus on planning/analysis
- Subscription model
- Educational content

### Option 3: Radical Simplification (30% success probability)
**Target**: Nevada residents only

**Modified Requirements**:
- Single state compliance
- One portfolio option
- Manual operations acceptable
- Minimal feature set

## Implementation Roadmap

**Cost**: $3.5M
**Features**:
- Basic user onboarding
- Single portfolio (60/40)
- Nevada only
- Manual operations

**Success Criteria**:
- 100 customers onboarded
- $1M AUM
- Regulatory approval

### Phase 2: Growth (Months 13-24)
**Cost**: $8-10M
**Features**:
- 3-5 state expansion
- Multiple portfolios
- Basic automation
- Mobile app

**Success Criteria**:
- 1,000 customers

**Features**:
- National presence
- Advanced features
- Full automation
- AI-driven insights

**Success Criteria**:
- 10,000+ customers
- $500M+ AUM
- Path to profitability

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Critical Risks
1. **Regulatory Compliance Failure**
   - Mitigation: Hire compliance officer Day 1
   - Budget: $1M/year for compliance

2. **High Customer Acquisition Cost**
   - Mitigation: Partner with financial institutions
   - Target: < $600 CAC

3. **Custodian Integration Delays**
   - Mitigation: Start integration immediately
   - Have backup custodian options

### Technology Risks
1. **Security Breach**
   - Mitigation: Security-first development
   - Regular penetration testing
   - Cyber insurance

2. **Scalability Issues**
   - Mitigation: Load testing from Day 1
   - Cloud-native architecture
   - Auto-scaling policies

## Kailash SDK Integration Strategy

### Core SDK Components
```python
# Example: Customer onboarding workflow
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
from kailash.runtime.local import LocalRuntime

workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
workflow.add_node("KYCValidatorNode", "kyc_check", {
    "customer_data": "input.customer_info",
    "verification_level": "enhanced"
})
workflow.add_node("RiskAssessmentNode", "risk_profile", {
    "customer_id": "kyc_check.customer_id",
    "questionnaire": "input.risk_questions"
})
workflow.add_node("PortfolioAllocationNode", "allocate", {
    "risk_profile": "risk_profile.score",
    "investment_amount": "input.amount"
})

runtime = LocalRuntime()
results, run_id = runtime.execute(workflow.build())
```

### Custom Financial Nodes
- KYCValidatorNode
- CustodianIntegrationNode
- ComplianceMonitorNode
- TaxReportingNode
- RebalancingNode

## Conclusion

Building Kronos requires:
1. **Realistic expectations**: 3-5 years, $60-100M investment
2. **Phased approach**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
3. **Compliance focus**: Build regulatory compliance from Day 1
4. **Technical excellence**: Use proven technologies, test thoroughly
5. **Market validation**: Consider B2B or planning tools as alternatives

The requirements acknowledge the extreme complexity while providing a pragmatic path forward. Success depends on exceptional execution, patient capital, and willingness to adapt based on market feedback.
